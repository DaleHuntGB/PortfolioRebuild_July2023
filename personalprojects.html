            <p>WeakAuras is a powerful and flexible framework that allows the display of highly customizable graphics on World of Warcraft's user interface to indicate buffs, debuffs, and other relevant information. This addon was created to be a lightweight replacement for Power Auras but has since introduced more functionalities while remaining efficient and easy to use.</p>

            <br>
            <p>The majority of my WeakAuras are created with the aim of improving the existing World of Warcraft user-interface by offering additional options and flexibility. These are published for all users to import and utilize in their user-interface setups. Alongside this, I am also responsible for ensuring that all user-interfaces and WeakAuras are correct for my raiding team and provide support through Discord to all raiders if they so wish.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Not all WeakAuras are required to built using LUA or custom code at all, however, below are some of the more complicated pieces that I have wrote and published.</p>

            <p>Prison Run is a first-person game fully developed in Unity. The idea of the game is to escape the prison without being detected by patrolling NPCs, throughout the game you will find clues that hint towards a final keypad code that allows for you to complete the final level and escape, however, before reaching the keypad you are required to fight off a few waves of NPCs after you gain access to the Weapon Room. There are a few different weapons to choose from, all have individual fire rates and magazine sizes.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Elite Parkour was a game demostration that was fully developed in Unreal Engine 5. The idea behind the game was to showcase a game with multiple in-game mechanics, additionally, the template provided was that of the Third-Person. The First-Person camera swap was incorporated by myself to utilize in different aspect of the map.
                <br><br>
                All mechanics, despite basic, display fine tweaking that was required to ensure that the player character was not moving unnaturally. Lastly, I added checkpoints so that players that struggled to progress through the levels were able to still continue playing. Checkpoints are a basic system that re-assign the player starting point when colliding with a specific blueprint.
